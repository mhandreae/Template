  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To develop a method for assigning Medicare enrollees and the physicians who serve them to individual hospitals with adequate validity to allow population-based assessments of provider specific costs and quality of care. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING The study populations consist of a 20 percent sample of Medicare fee-for-service enrollees and all physicians submitting claims for Medicare services from 1998 to 2000. Data were obtained from Medicare claims and enrollment files, Medicare's MPIER file, and from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey. STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis of the characteristics of hospitals, their extended medical staffs (EMSs) and the utilization patterns of their assigned Medicare enrollees. DATA COLLECTION METHODS Medicare enrollees were assigned to their predominant ambulatory physician and then to the hospital where that physician provided inpatient services or where a plurality of that physician's patient panel had medical admissions. Each beneficiary was linked to a physician and a hospital regardless of whether the patient was hospitalized creating Ambulatory Provider Specific Cohorts (APSCs). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Ninety-six percent of eligible Medicare enrollees who had an index physician visit in 1998 were assigned to a specific provider. Two-thirds of the medical admissions during a 2-year period occurred at the assigned hospital and two-thirds of evaluation and management services were billed by the assigned hospital's EMS. The empirically derived EMS for hospitals had reasonable face and discriminant validity in terms of number and type of physicians practicing at different sized and type hospitals. Estimates of risk-adjusted costs across physician groups in year one are highly predictive of costs in a subsequent year (r=0.87, p{\textless}.0001 and weighted kappa=0.65, p{\textless}.0001). CONCLUSIONS Medicare claims data can be used to assign virtually all Medicare enrollees to empirically defined care systems comprised of hospitals and the physicians who practice at these hospitals. Studies of patterns of practice, costs and outcomes of care experienced by these APSCs could complement other methods of monitoring provider performance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Clinical practice guidelines summarize evidence from science and attempt to translate those findings into clinical practice. Pervasive and consistent adoption of these guidelines into daily provider practice has proven slow. METHODS Using postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis guideline compliance as our metric, we compared the effects of continuing medical education (CME) alone (I), CME with a single snapshot of provider compliance (II), and ongoing reporting of provider compliance data without further CME (III). We retrospectively analyzed guideline compliance of 23,279 anesthetics at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Compliance was defined as a patient with 1 risk factor for PONV receiving at least 1 antiemetic, 2 risk factors receiving at least 2 antiemetics, and 3 risk factors receiving at least 3 antiemetics. Drugs of the same class were counted as single antiemetic administration. Propofol-based anesthetic techniques were counted as receiving 1 antiemetic. Patients with 0 risk factors for PONV were not included. We estimated the compliance rates for each of the 4 time periods of the study adjusting for multiple observations on the same clinician. Individual performance feedback was given once at 6 months after intervention I coincident with a refresher presentation on PONV (start of intervention II) and on an ongoing quarterly basis during intervention III. RESULTS Compliance rates were not significantly influenced with CME (intervention I) compared with baseline behavior (54.5{\%} vs 54.4{\%}, P = 0.9140). Significant improvement occurred during the time period when CME was paired with performance data (intervention II) compared with intervention I (59.2{\%} vs 54.4{\%}, P = 0.0002). Further significant improvement occurred when data alone were presented (intervention III) compared with intervention II (65.1{\%} vs 59.2{\%}, P {\textless} 0.0001). For patients with 3 risk factors, we saw significant improvement in compliance rates during intervention III (P = 0.0002). In post hoc analysis of overtreatment, the percentage differences between the baseline and time period III decreased as the number of risk factors increased. CONCLUSIONS We observed the greatest improvement in guideline compliance with ongoing personal performance feedback. Provider feedback can be an effective tool to modify clinical practice but can have unanticipated consequences.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Guidelines to minimize the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) have been implemented in many hospitals. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that guideline adherence is suboptimal and can be improved using decision support (DS). In this study, we investigate whether DS improves patient outcome through improving physician behaviour. METHODS Medical information of surgical patients is routinely entered in our anaesthesia information management system (AIMS), which includes automated reminders for PONV management based on the simplified risk score by Apfel and colleagues. This study included consecutive adult patients undergoing general anaesthesia for elective non-cardiac surgery who were treated according to the normal clinical routine. The presence of PONV was recorded in the AIMS both during the recovery period and at 24 h. Two periods were studied: one without the use of DS (control period) and one with the use of DS (support period). DS consisted of reminders on PONV both in the preoperative screening clinic and at the time of anaesthesia. RESULTS In the control period, 981 patients, of whom 378 (29{\%}) were high-risk patients, received general anaesthesia. Overall, 264 (27{\%}) patients experienced PONV within 24 h. In the support period, 1681 patients, of whom 525 (32{\%}) had a high risk for PONV, received general anaesthesia. In this period, only 378 (23{\%}) patients experienced PONV within 24 h after operation. This difference is statistically significant (P=0.01). CONCLUSION Automated reminders can improve patient outcome by improving guideline adherence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Correct identification of patients at high risk for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), prescription of PONV prophylaxis and correct administration of medication are all important for effective PONV prophylaxis. This has been acknowledged by development of guidelines throughout the world. We studied the effect of introducing patient-specific automated reminders on timely administration of PONV prophylaxis medication during general anaesthesia. METHODS During the visit to the preoperative screening clinic, patients at high risk for PONV were identified and PONV prophylaxis was prescribed. To study the effect of patient-specific decision support [a pop-up window reminding the (nurse) anaesthetist that PONV prophylaxis had been prescribed for this particular patient] on the timely administration of PONV medication, we queried our database to extract data on all patients for three consecutive periods: 6 weeks before decision support (control), 12 weeks during decision support and 6 weeks after discontinuation of decision support (postdecision support) and studied how often PONV prophylaxis was administered correctly. RESULTS Between November 2005 and May 2006, 1727, 2594 and 1331 patients presented for elective surgery in the control, decision support and postdecision support periods, respectively. In the control period, 236 patients receiving general anaesthesia were scheduled to receive PONV prophylaxis. Of these, 93 (39{\%}) received both dexamethasone and granisetron in the correct timeframe. This increased to 464 (79{\%}) out of 591 patients in the decision support period and decreased back to 99 (41{\%}) out of 243 patients in the postdecision support period (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION Decision support is effective in improving administration and timing of PONV prophylaxis medication. After withdrawal of decision support, adherence decreased to predecision support levels.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Guidelines for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prevention are implemented widely but their effectiveness may be limited by poor adherence. We hypothesized that the use of an electronic decision support (DS) system would significantly improve guideline adherence. METHODS Medical information of all patients undergoing elective surgery in our regional teaching hospital is routinely entered in an anesthesia information management system at the preoperative screening clinic. Our departmental PONV prevention guidelines identifies patients as "high-risk" and thus eligible for PONV prophylaxis based on the presence of at least three of the following risk factors: female gender, history of PONV or motion sickness, nonsmoker status, and anticipated use of postoperative opioids. Using automated reminders, we studied the effect of DS on guidelines adherence using an off-on-off design. In these three study periods, we queried for all consecutive patients visiting the preoperative screening clinic who were eligible for PONV prophylaxis and studied how often it was prescribed correctly. RESULTS Between November 2005 and June 2006, 1340, 2715, and 1035 patients were included in the control, DS and post-DS periods, respectively. As a result of mandatory data entry of risk factors, the percentage of high-risk PONV patients increased from 28{\%} in the control period to 32{\%} and 31{\%} in the DS and post-DS periods, respectively. During the control period, 38{\%} of all high-risk patients were prescribed PONV prophylaxis. This increased to 73{\%} during the DS period and decreased to 37{\%} in the post-DS period.

Other significant predictors were female gender, advanced age, longer duration of surgery, larger volume of infusions, intubation, spinal anaesthesia, intraoperative use of opioids and non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, high pain score, nausea and vomiting and prolonged preoperative waiting time. Chart review of patients admitted to hospital confirmed the validity of the statistically significant predictors.

The goal of this study was to quantify patients' preferences for postoperative anesthesia outcomes. One hundred one patients in the preoperative clinic completed a written survey. Patients were asked to rank (order) 10 possible postoperative outcomes from their most undesirable to their least undesirable outcome. Each outcome was described in simple language. Patients were also asked to distribute {\$}100 among the 10 outcomes, proportionally more money being allocated to the more undesirable outcomes. The dollar allocations were used to determine the relative value of each outcome. Rankings and relative value scores correlated closely (r2 = 0.69). Patients rated from most undesirable to least undesirable (in order): vomiting, gagging on the tracheal tube, incisional pain, nausea, recall without pain, residual weakness, shivering, sore throat, and somnolence (F-test {\textless} 0.01). IMPLICATIONS Although there is variability in how patients rated postoperative outcomes, avoiding nausea/vomiting, incisional pain, and gagging on the endotracheal tube was a high priority for most patients. Whether clinicians can improve the quality of anesthesia by designing anesthesia regimens that most closely meet each individual patient's preferences for clinical outcomes deserves further study.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Recently, two centers have independently developed a risk score for predicting postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). This study investigated (1) whether risk scores are valid across centers and (2) whether risk scores based on logistic regression coefficients can be simplified without loss of discriminating power. METHODS Adult patients from two centers (Oulu, Finland: n = 520, and Wuerzburg, Germany: n = 2202) received inhalational anesthesia (without antiemetic prophylaxis) for various types of surgery. PONV was defined as nausea or vomiting within 24 h of surgery. Risk scores to estimate the probability of PONV were obtained by fitting logistic regression models. Simplified risk scores were constructed based on the number of risk factors that were found significant in the logistic regression analyses. Original and simplified scores were cross-validated. A combined data set was created to estimate a potential center effect and to construct a final risk score. The discriminating power of each score was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS Risk scores derived from one center were able to predict PONV from the other center (area under the curve = 0.65-0.75). Simplification did not essentially weaken the discriminating power (area under the curve = 0.63-0.73). No center effect could be detected in a combined data set (odds ratio = 1.06, 95{\%} confidence interval = 0.71-1.59). The final score consisted of four predictors: female gender, history of motion sickness (MS) or PONV, nonsmoking, and the use of postoperative opioids. If none, one, two, three, or four of these risk factors were present, the incidences of PONV were 10{\%}, 21{\%}, 39{\%}, 61{\%} and 79{\%}. CONCLUSIONS The risk scores derived from one center proved valid in the other and could be simplified without significant loss of discriminating power. Therefore, it appears that this risk score has broad applicability in predicting PONV in adult patients undergoing inhalational anesthesia for various types of surgery. For patients with at least two out of these four identified predictors a prophylactic antiemetic strategy should be considered.},

These images were sent via e-mail and visualized on a standard 17-inch screen of a personal computer. After the follow-up period, self-reported patient satisfaction was assessed by analyzing the replies to a 9-item questionnaire. Thirty of the 96 patients (31.3{\%}) reported local problems including: hematoma in 20 (66.7{\%}) patients, surgical bandage blood-stained in 7 (23.3{\%}), exudates in 1 (3.3{\%}), allergic skin reactions in 1 (3.3{\%}), and bandage too tight in 1 (3.3{\%}). In total, 225 photographs were evaluated by 3 physicians. In all cases, it was possible to identify and assess the postoperative problem with consensus among the 3 physicians. Images served to resolve patients' concerns in 20 individuals (66.7{\%}). In 10 patients (33.3{\%}), concerns were satisfied but it was suggested that follow-up images be sent in the following days. Only 1 patient (3.3{\%}) was asked to visit the hospital. The telemedicine system proposed increases the efficiency of home follow-up to ambulatory surgery, avoids unnecessary hospital visits, and clearly improves patient satisfaction.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is common but many episodes may be trivial or transient. The aim of the study was to develop a simple-to-use measure of the intensity and clinical impact of PONV. METHODS We re-analysed data from a study enrolling 163 patients recovering from surgery and anaesthesia that had experienced or were at increased risk of developing PONV. A range of measures of PONV characteristics and quality of recovery were collected. We devised a simplified nausea-vomiting impact scale based on patients' assessment of the impact of their nausea on their postoperative recovery and the number of times they experienced vomiting. We then undertook further tests of construct and discriminant validity, and reliability and responsiveness, of the impact scale using psychometric methodology. RESULTS Around one in five patients with PONV had features that could classify them as having clinically important PONV. We found that patients with clinically important PONV had a much poorer quality of recovery (P{\textless}0.0005), needed more antiemetic administrations for treatment (P{\textless}0.0005), and were more likely to have consequences and complications of PONV (all P{\textless}0.01), when compared with those with lesser degrees of PONV. A change in clinically important PONV status can be reliably detected with the PONV impact scale. CONCLUSIONS We have devised and validated a simplified PONV impact scale that can be used to identify those with clinically important PONV. The avoidance of clinically important PONV could be used as a quality indicator or outcome measure after surgery.},

  abstract  = {In a contemporary clinical laboratory it is very common to have to assess the agreement between two quantitative methods of measurement. The correct statistical approach to assess this degree of agreement is not obvious. Correlation and regression studies are frequently proposed. However, correlation studies the relationship between one variable and another, not the differences, and it is not recommended as a method for assessing the comparability between methods.  In 1983 Altman and Bland (B{\&}A) proposed an alternative analysis, based on the quantification of the agreement between two quantitative measurements by studying the mean difference and constructing limits of agreement.  The B{\&}A plot analysis is a simple way to evaluate a bias between the mean differences, and to estimate an agreement interval, within which 95{\%} of the differences of the second method, compared to the first one, fall. Data can be analyzed both as unit differences plot and as percentage differences plot.  The B{\&}A plot method only defines the intervals of agreements, it does not say whether those limits are acceptable or not. Acceptable limits must be defined a priori, based on clinical necessity, biological considerations or other goals.  The aim of this article is to provide guidance on the use and interpretation of Bland Altman analysis in method comparison studies.},
